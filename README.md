# hello-world
First repository of ideas and such

Hello Git-world!

I'm new to coding and trying to learn and implement crazy ideas along the way. Hopefully, one day these ideas will be useful. I am focusing on Python as a language and my profession is in the physical sciences. My aim is to combine these worlds to make my life better and easier.
